# Abstract 

When assumptions of a parametric model are violated or not met, the inference of those models can not be trusted. For such situations we shift to non-parametric methods like bootstrap and Jack Knife. In our report we will discuss about Jack Knife, how it can be used to calculate the standard error of mean of seal body length.
